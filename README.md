# PokeShinyHunter
## Overview

An upcoming android app to keep track of all your shiny hunts in pokemon games! You can individually select what icon you want 
for your pokemon as well as give it a platform for color!

This application uses an API called PokeAPI. Learn more about it here: https://pokeapi.co/

## Features

* ALL 893 Pokemon available (Alolan + Other forms support released later)
* Individual icons for each pokemon that is currently supported by PokeAPI
* Sorting between newest/oldest, pokemon names/id, game, and count
* Redo a count, set up your own increment number per click, editing pokemon mid-hunt (soon), and options (soon)

### Starting a hunt
To start a hunt, you have to fill out the necessary parameters(can be changed later if you use more than 1 game or get a pitybreaker!): 
The game you're hunting on, the pokemon, the platform, and the method that you wish to use!
